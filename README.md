## About
`timetable-gen` is a command-line tool designed to simplify the creation of 
timetables. 
It takes a configuration file in TOML format as input, processes the given data, 
and outputs a neatly organized timetable in PDF format. 
The output PDF will be in A4 landscape orientation, with the classes matrix 
fitted as needed according to your configuration file.

## Configuration
The configuration of `timetable-gen` is done through a TOML file. 
Here's the structure of the configuration file:

```toml
class_name = "0x"
class_room = "RN"
class_teacher = "Class Teacher"

title = "School Year"
subtitle = "Semester"

school_name = "School Name"
school_address = "School Address"

class_durations = [
    "07:55 - 08:40",
    ...
    "16:05 - 16:50"
]

[day_identifiers]
monday = "Mo"
...

[[monday]]
class = "Subject 1"
teacher = "Teacher 1"
room = "Room 1"

[[monday]]
class = "Subject 2"
teacher = true
room = true
...
```

- `class_name`: The name of the class.
- `class_room`: The room code for the classroom.
- `class_teacher`: The name for the class teacher.
- `title`: The title of the timetable.
- `subtitle`: The subtitle of the timetable.

  The subjects, teachers, and rooms for each day of the week. 
  Each day is represented as a list of `ClassEntry` objects, all fields are

  For `teacher` and `room` the values may also be `true`, to use the class 
  teacher/room.
  - `class`: The subject being taught.
  - `teacher`: The teacher teaching the subject.
  - `room`: The room in which the class is being held.

### Example Configuration

as this is the default file aht the CLI will look for.
